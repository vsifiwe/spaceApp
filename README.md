Team Flash's Hackathon entry for the 2020 SpaceApp challenge

NASA History in a Flash is a mobile App aimed at educating young people who are interested in space. It summarizes and showcases different achievements from NASA and memorable points in NASA's history through videos and pictures and even podcasts

This project produced a mobile app. It aims to inform and show NASA enthusiasts about different projects undertaken by NASA through YouTube videos, images and podcasts to bring hard to find NASA information easily to the public. A user simply launches the app and chooses an interesting topic to watch and interact with. We hope to bring this amazing media easily to young people who are interested in NASA and space exploration in general.

It is written in JavaScript on a platform called expo which means it can run on android and ios easily

`cd spaceApp`
`yarn install` or `npm install` based on which one you prefer using
